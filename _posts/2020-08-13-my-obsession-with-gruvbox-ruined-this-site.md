Hey y'all. If you're reading this, it means that the old glorious website I had is gone.
It also means that you're reading this on https://bsavage.xyz, which is the new
web address you'll find all my content on (and I intend to keep this one). I plan to
write about my Linux experience, and experience in general on this website, and you actually
can subscribe to the RSS feed now (tysm [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)). And here the things
that I'm planning to roll out on this location.

- Open Source and Go stuff.
- Linux Gaming updates
- My daily life with Linux, and maybe some cool little things about it

And naturally, this website has Gruvbox colors.

## So what is Gruvbox?

[Gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox) is a color scheme that was originally designed
for Vim with *retro groove* pastel colors and light/dark switch. The main focus of this
color scheme is to keep colors easily distinguishable, maintain a good contrast, and be
easy on eyes. And here are those palettes so you can see how damn good they are!
