where my role is to learn and evolve technology, as we continue to build and ship amazing software to our clients.</p><p>I started up as a web developer, responsible for making changes to our HTML5 websites, which were built and served
by an ancient Java-based platform. Eventually, I got myself into maintaining that platform itself, and started driving
my career into the path of software architecture.</p><p>With time, I learnt to deliver software that works well. I learnt how cloud technologies work, and migrated one of our
core products to AWS.</p><p>Finally, I built <a href=https://www.clowre.com>Clowre</a>, that helped us build and ship quality software in a even faster and
reliable way, as well as opening our team to a very diverse set of tech stacks.</p><p>As a Software Architect, I strongly beleive that software development is such a profession which will always stay young.
As people evolve, tech will evolve too. Developing new technology will become accessible to more and more people.</p><hr><p>This website is supposed to be a place where I share my experiences with tech, or write about stuff in general. Though this
is probably the hundreth reskin of this page, I hope it finally stays this way. As evident in the commit history of this
website&rsquo;s repository, I hope that I follow through the promise of writing more content for here!</p></div></div><div id=footer class=mb-5><hr><div class="container text-center"><a href=https://github.com/realbucksavage class="fab fa-github fa-1x" title=GitHub></a>
