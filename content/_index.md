Jay here!

I'm working on supercharging [Sarvika Technologies](https://www.sarvika.com) using my passion for tech since 2013.
Here, my role is to learn and evolve software, as we continue to create and ship amazing software to our clients.

I started up as a web developer, responsible for making changes to our HTML5 websites served by an elden Java-based platform. Eventually, I got myself into maintaining that platform itself and started driving my career into the path of software architecture.

With time, I learned to deliver software that scales with the organizations using them. I learned how cloud technologies work, migrated one of our core products to a distributed architecture, and moved it to the cloud.

Finally, I built [Clowre](https://www.clowre.com), which helped our team to build and ship quality software in an even faster and more reliable way, and introduced us to an even larger tech stack.

As an Enterprise Architect, I strongly believe that software development is a profession that will always stay young. As people evolve, technology will evolve too. Creating new technology will become accessible to more and more people.

This website is supposed to be a place where I share my experiences with tech, or write about stuff in general. Though this is probably the hundredth reskin of this page, I hope it finally stays this way. As evident in the commit history of this website's repository, I hope that I follow through with the promise of writing more content here!
