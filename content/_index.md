Jay here!

I'm working on supercharging [Sarvika Technologies](https://www.sarvika.com) using my passion about tech since 2013,
where my role is to learn and evolve technology, as we continue to build and ship amazing software to our clients.

I started up as a web developer, responsible for making changes to our HTML5 websites, which were built and served
by an ancient Java-based platform. Eventually, I got myself into maintaining that platform itself, and started driving
my career into the path of software architecture.

With time, I learnt to deliver software that works well. I learnt how cloud technologies work, and migrated one of our
core products to AWS. 

Finally, I built [Clowre](https://www.clowre.com), that helped us build and ship quality software in a even faster and
reliable way, as well as opening our team to a very diverse set of tech stacks.

As a Software Architect, I strongly beleive that software development is such a profession which will always stay young.
As people evolve, tech will evolve too. Developing new technology will become accessible to more and more people.

This website is supposed to be a place where I share my experiences with tech, or write about stuff in general. Though this
is probably the hundreth reskin of this page, I hope it finally stays this way. As evident in the commit history of this
website's repository, I hope that I follow through the promise of writing more content for here!
